     * Reqs:
     * Signal recorded -> present submit -> signal cmdbuf submitted:
     * Need to have a way to wait for submission on CPU due to present not supporting timeline semaphores.
     * Hence create one binary semaphore per signal operation, together with a CV that is signalled on submission. Then wait on CV before queue present. Semaphore ownership needs to be transferred
     * Wait recorded -> wait submitted -> signal recorded -> signal submitted
     * Handled by timeline semaphores by default
     *
     * Misc:
     * Cmdbufs will need to be split up based on sync boundaries - a single guest cmdbuf may need to spluit into multiple host cmdbufs and submissions
